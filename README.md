The objective of this Final Project for the Higher Degree in Multiplatform Application Development is to create an Android application utilizing NFC functionality, which is present in the majority of mobile phones on the market. This application aims to facilitate various games, activities, and interactions using NFC cards.


In recent years, particularly following the 2020 COVID-19 confinement, the video game market has experienced unprecedented growth, surpassing even the film industry in terms of revenue. However, this surge has impacted the routines of younger generations significantly.

Recent studies, such as those published in the "American Journal of Play," highlight a drastic reduction in outdoor play among children under 12 over the past few decades. This decline has been linked to increased cases of anxiety, depression, and other related conditions.


The NFC PLAY! application is designed to address these concerns by merging modern technology with classic outdoor games. By leveraging NFC-enabled mobile devices, children can engage in a variety of outdoor activities that encourage physical movement and social interaction, reminiscent of traditional games played outdoors.

Features of NFC PLAY!:
 
  - NFC Integration: Utilizes NFC technology present in smartphones for game interactions with NFC cards.

  - Outdoor Games Revival: Offers a collection of traditional outdoor games adapted for mobile interaction, encouraging children to play outside.

  - Promotion of Physical Activity: Aims to counter sedentary lifestyles by motivating children to be active through gameplay.
  
  - Social Interaction: Facilitates socialization among peers as well as intergenerational play between children and adults.

  - Educational Aspects: Incorporates learning elements into gameplay to enhance cognitive development and problem-solving skills.


In conclusion, NFC PLAY! seeks to revive outdoor play experiences by integrating them with the convenience of modern mobile technology. By doing so, the application aims not only to entertain but also to promote physical activity, social interaction, and overall well-being among children. This project represents a meaningful contribution to addressing the challenges posed by increasing digitalization and sedentary lifestyles among today's youth.
